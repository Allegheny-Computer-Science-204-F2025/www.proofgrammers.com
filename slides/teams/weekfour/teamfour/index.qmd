# Introduction

::: {.fragment style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"} 
- Goal : Prove that longerThan10 is uncomputable.
- Returns "yes" if P(I) is a string of more than 10 CHARACTERS
- Returns "no" otherwise
:::

## What is Longerthan10 Program?

- This program takes two parameters (P, I). It returns “yes” if P(I) is a string of more than 10 characters,and “no” otherwise.

## Can we write a program that computes longerThan10?

- The short answer is "NO", we can't! Because it's UNCOMPUTABLE.

## Why is `longerThan10` uncomputable?
**The Flow Diagram**

- If longerThan10 were possible, we could solve the famous Halting Problem and we know its impossible to solve the Halting Problem. So longerThan10 is uncomputable.


## Program Name and Behavior

`LongerThan10(P,I)`
- Return "yes", if `P` is greater than or equal to 10 characters on input `I`
- Return "no" otherwise

`LongerThan10OnSelf(P)`
- Return "yes", if `P` is greater than or equal to 10 characters on input `P`
- Return "no" otherwise

`TroubleLongerThan10(P)`
-  If `P` is at least 10 characters on input `P`, return a string with fewer than 10 characters
- Otherwise, return a string with at least 10 characters

- This proves that `LongerThan10` cannot exist because it produces a contradiction.

## "Code"

```Python
from TroubleLongerThan10 
import TroubleLongerThan10

def TroubleLongerThan10(P)(progString):
    val = TroubleLongerThan10(progString)
    if val == 'yes':
        # Return a string with fewer than 10 characters
        return "short"
    else:
        # Return a string with at least 10 characters
        return "this_is_long"
```

- This is non runnable Python code that shows the logic of the "Longer than 10" issue and why it cannot exist.
