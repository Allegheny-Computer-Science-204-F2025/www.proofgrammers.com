# Introduction

::: {.fragment style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.8em;"} 
- Goal : Prove that longerThan10 is uncomputable.
- `true` if P runs for more than 10 steps on input P
- `false` if P runs for 10 or fewer steps on input P
:::

## What is Longerthan10 Program?

- The longerThan10 function takes a program as input and    tries to answer: "Will this program run for more than 10 steps when given itself as input?" It should return true if yes, false if no.
  
## Can we write a program that computes longerThan10?

- The short answer is "NO", we can't! Because it's UNCOMPUTABLE.

## Why is `longerThan10` uncomputable?
**The Flow Diagram**

- If longerThan10 were possible, we could solve the famous Halting Problem and we know its impossible to solve the Halting Problem. So longerThan10 is uncomputable.


## Program Name and Behavior

`GreaterThanOrEqualTo10(P,I)`
- Return "yes", if `P` is greater than or equal to 10 characters on input `I`
- Return "no" otherwise

`GreaterThanOrEqualTo10OnSelf(P)`
- Return "yes", if `P` is greater than or equal to 10 characters on input `P`
- Return "no" otherwise

`TroubleGreaterThanOrEqualTo10(P)`
-  If `P` is at least 10 characters on input `P`, return a string with fewer than 10 characters
- Otherwise, return a string with at least 10 characters

- This proves that `GreaterThanOrEqualTo10` cannot exist because it produces a contradiction.

## "Code"

```Python
from TroubleGreaterThanOrEqualTo10 
import TroubleGreaterThanOrEqualTo10

def Trouble>=10(P)(progString):
    val = TroubleGreaterThanOrEqualTo10(progString)
    if val == 'yes':
        # Return a string with fewer than 10 characters
        return "short"
    else:
        # Return a string with at least 10 characters
        return "this_is_long"
```

- This is non runnable Python code that shows the logic of the "greater than 10" issue and why it cannot exist.
