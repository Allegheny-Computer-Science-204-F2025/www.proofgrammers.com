## Introduction

::: {.fragment}
- Today, we will talk about the problem called `startsWithZ`.  
- The question is simple: **Can we decide whether a program’s output begins with the letter “Z”?**
- At first glance, this looks easy—just run the program and check its output.  
- However, we will see that this problem is actually incomputable,
  and we will explain why using a **proof by contradiction**.
